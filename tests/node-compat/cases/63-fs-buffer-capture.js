// fs must not resolve Buffer through the mutable `node:buffer` exports.
//
// `js/internal/fs.js` is a LAZY internal module: its factory does not run until user code
// calls require('fs'). A `require('buffer').Buffer` capture at ITS module-eval therefore
// reads whatever the exports object holds by then — and that is the same object user code
// holds. §5's "capture at module-eval is safe" rule only holds for modules the LOADER
// instantiates before user code, which fs is not.
//
// The realistic shape is not adversarial. A dependency's top-level body runs before the
// app's first require('fs'), and assigning `exports.Buffer` is something real packages do
// (browserify's buffer shim, test doubles, instrumentation). With a late capture, such a
// package both READS every file the app loads and REWRITES what the app receives:
//
//   node       app sees: "top secret"   dep captured: []
//   lava (pre) app sees: "TAMPERED"     dep captured: ["top secret"]
//
// loader.js snapshots Buffer.from / isEncoding / prototype.toString immediately after it
// eager-instantiates buffer, and hands them to every migrated internal module as
// `require.pristineBuffer`, so the capture provably precedes user code. (fs took them
// through its `natives` argument until #333 unified the two channels.)
//
// This is an ORACLE case rather than a Lava-only one because the fix makes Lava agree with
// node: node's fs builds its result from an internal binding, so the shim never sees it.
