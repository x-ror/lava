// process.stdout / process.stderr — the shape node exposes, diffed against node.
//
// Node's `process.stdout` is polymorphic by fd type, which is the part a reimplementation
// gets wrong. Measured against node 24.18.1:
//
//   stdout ->  constructor        write(300KB)   isTTY      columns
//   file       SyncWriteStream    true           undefined  undefined
//   pipe       Socket             false          undefined  undefined
//   tty        WriteStream        true           true        <number>
//
// This case runs under the compat harness, which redirects both streams to files, so it
// pins the NON-TTY half only. The TTY half needs a pty and is NOT pinned anywhere yet —
// an earlier version of this comment cited cmd/lava/process_stdio_test.odin, which does
// not exist. Tracked in ROADMAP beside the TIOCGWINSZ entry.
//
// `instanceof stream.Writable` is true for node in all three cases, which is why this is
// built on the real Writable rather than a lookalike: libraries feature-detect with it.

// an attempt to do it inside this PR introduced two regressions (a DataView poisoned
// writableLength to NaN and permanently stalled pipe(); the throw also moved the pipe()
// error from the writable onto the readable), so it is reverted and tracked in ROADMAP
// as its own change with its own tests.
