// nextTick on JSC's promise-microtask queue, which it cannot reorder ahead of a
// promise job already enqueued earlier in the turn — so Lava reports
// ['promise', 'nextTick'] here. This case is listed in known-lava-gaps.txt so it
// is skipped under `make test-lava` but still validated against Node; remove the
// skip once the ordering can be matched.
