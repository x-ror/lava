# Gate routing — which commands a change must pass

Source of truth is the `Makefile` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. If they
disagree with this table, they win — and fix this table.

**Who runs these.** On a PR, `ci.yml`'s Linux job executes the always-block plus
every routed smoke, on both I/O backends. Nothing else runs them: `/pr-gate` is
invoked by a human, locally, and `--review-only` (which executes no `make`
target and reads CI's conclusions instead) is for reviewing from a machine
without the toolchain. **Five** routed targets are **not** in CI — `make bun-buffer-tests`,
`make api-surface`, `make test-compat-lava-strict`, `make bench-gate`, and
`make bench-http` — so a diff that routes to one of those needs a local run, or a
new CI step if it should be enforced. (`make bench` is in CI but **report-only**
and cannot fail.) (`make test-scripts` runs in CI inside `make check-js`;
`make test-property` is its own CI step since batching took it from 64s to ~1s;
`make test-mutation` is its own CI step because it rebuilds `bin/lava` once per
embedded-JS mutation.)

**Machine-readable routing:** `node runtime/gates/route-gates.mjs <paths>`
(or `--from-git`). Prefer that over hand-parsing this table; if Makefile/ci.yml
disagree with this file, they win — fix this file.

| Command                   | Covers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `make check`              | Odin type-check of `cmd/lava`, `pkg/runtime`, `eventloop`, `picohttpparser`, `pkg/std/sqlite`, `pkg/jsc` — **plus** cross-target front-end checks for `windows_amd64` and `darwin_arm64`. A change that breaks a platform stub fails here.                                                                                             |
| `make build`              | Links `bin/lava`. Required before every `*-lava`, smoke, or bench target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `make test`               | Odin unit tests + oracle suites (`scripts/run-tests.sh`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `make test-lava`          | Every oracle suite the platform supports, node-vs-Lava (`run-oracles.sh`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `make test-lava-nohostfn` | The same suites with `LAVA_HOSTFN_DISABLE=1`, i.e. every native built by the public C API instead of JSC's private host-call ABI. Runs unconditionally in CI and is the only coverage of the C-API fallback; a failure blocks like any always-gate, and doubly so for changes under `pkg/jsc`, `host_natives.odin`, or `require.odin`. |
| `make test-odin-serial`   | `cmd/lava` tests on ONE runner thread — the only configuration where several `lava.eval` sites share a thread, and therefore the thread-local host-native registry and JSC's recycled context addresses. ~0.25s.                                                                                                                       |

`make fmt` (`odin strip-semicolon`) before committing Odin.
`make check-js` whenever any `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` under `pkg/runtime/js`, `tests`,
`scripts`, or `bench` changed — it runs format, lint, orphan-JS detection, and the
primordials ratchet.
`make check-md` whenever any `.md` changed — markdownlint over the repo's own docs
(config and the rationale for its two disabled rules: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`).
`make check-actions` whenever any `.github/workflows/*.yml` changed — actionlint
catches what a YAML parse cannot: a context used where it is not available, a bad
`needs`, shellcheck errors inside `run:`.

## Perf claims

Any PR titled `perf(...)`, or claiming speed/memory anywhere in its body, must
carry numbers: `make bench` (ratio table), `make bench-http` (throughput, latency,
memory per idle connection), or a profile. JSC sampling profiler:
`JSC_useSamplingProfiler=1` plus a dump directory.

`make bench` is report-only in CI today. `make bench-gate` enforces
`bench/thresholds.json`; run it locally when touching a floor.

## Backends

Networking has two I/O backends. The smokes that take `LAVA_NET_FORCE_READINESS=1`
run **twice** (proactor and readiness) — do not report a networking change as
verified from one backend.

Native-function creation has two backends for the same reason. Normally every
native is a JSC host function created through a dlsym'd private symbol; with
`LAVA_HOSTFN_DISABLE=1` (`make test-lava-nohostfn`) they all come from
`JSObjectMakeFunctionWithCallback` instead. The two are **not** observably
identical — `.length` and constructibility differ, see `inject_native_function` —
so a change to native registration is not verified from one of them either.

## Known-gap files

`known-lava-gaps.txt` (per suite) lists cases skipped under Lava.
`make test-compat-lava` skips them; `make test-compat-lava-strict` does not.
A diff that _adds_ a path to a gap file is a regression needing an explicit reason.
