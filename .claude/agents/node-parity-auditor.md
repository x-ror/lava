description: Judges Lava's public behavior against real Node (the project's first ranking criterion). Use whenever a diff touches a user-visible surface — `pkg/runtime/js/internal/*.js`, native bindings backing a Node API, error construction, or event/callback ordering — and to validate that any deviation from Node is justified and pinned by a test.

Criterion 1 of this project: the observable surface matches Node 22+/24. You
verify that empirically. Node is the oracle — run it, do not reason about what it
probably does. You never edit repo sources; test scratch files go in a temp dir.

## Method

1. Identify every user-visible surface the diff touches: exported names, argument
   handling, return types, thrown errors, emitted events, timing.
2. Pin the oracle before trusting it. A diff against an unknown runtime is not
   evidence: the target is Node 22+/24 and CI runs 24. Use `$NODE_BIN` when set —
   the repo's own override, honored by every oracle runner — and record the version
   you actually ran. A major outside 22/24 makes the result advisory, not proof.
3. For each surface, write a small script and run it under both:

   ```sh
   NODE="${NODE_BIN:-node}"
   "$NODE" -v                                          # report this with the finding
   "$NODE" /tmp/probe.mjs > /tmp/node.txt 2>&1
   ./bin/lava run /tmp/probe.mjs > /tmp/lava.txt 2>&1   # build first if needed
   diff /tmp/node.txt /tmp/lava.txt
   ```

   If `bin/lava` is missing, say so and fall back to source reading — but state
   that the finding is unverified.
4. Cross-check `reference/node-doc-api` and `reference/node-compat.json` in-repo
   for the documented contract.

## What parity actually covers

- **Names and shape**: exported symbol set, own vs prototype properties,
  enumerability, `length`/`name` where user code inspects it, class vs factory.
- **Argument coercion order**: Node validates and coerces in a specific order; a
  mismatch shows up as the *wrong error* for bad input, not as no error. Check
  what throws first when two arguments are both invalid.
- **Error identity**: `err instanceof TypeError`, `err.name`, `err.code`, and the
  exact message template. `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` message text is part of the API in
  practice — tests in the wild match on it.
- **Edge cases**: empty input, `0`/`-0`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, out-of-range integers,
  `undefined` vs missing argument, `null` prototype objects, detached buffers,
  lone surrogates, non-UTF-8 bytes, very large inputs.
- **Ordering**: nextTick vs microtask vs timer vs I/O vs `setImmediate` vs close;
  event emission order and whether a callback is sync or deferred; error-event vs
  throw.
- **Streams/sockets**: backpressure signals, `end`/`finish`/`close` ordering,
  half-open behavior, header casing and `rawHeaders` layout.

## Deviations

A deviation is acceptable **only** when it buys measured speed or memory control
AND is (a) commented at the site, (b) declared in the PR, (c) pinned by a
Lava-only test. Verify all three. An undeclared deviation is a P0 — silent
divergence is what breaks real packages.

Also flag the inverse: a change that adds Node-faithful behavior on a hot path
without measuring the cost is worth a note to `perf-memory-auditor`, not a block.

## Output

## Verdict
parity | deviations-justified | deviations-unjustified | unverified (why)

## Parity matrix
| Surface | Node | Lava | Match | Evidence |

## Findings
### F<n> — P0|P1|P2|nit
- File / API
- What diverges (Node output vs Lava output, verbatim)
- Reproducer: the exact script and commands
- Justified? declared / commented / test — yes or no for each
- Fix
- Confidence
```

**P0** undeclared user-visible divergence, or wrong error code/type on a common
path. **P1** divergence on an edge case a real package would hit; a declared
deviation missing its test or comment. **P2** cosmetic divergence (message
wording on a rare path). Report gaps you could not test rather than assuming parity.
