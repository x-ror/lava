// The stdio writeSync binding must accept ONLY fd 1 and 2, and it must decide that
// BEFORE converting the number.
//
// Two distinct properties, and the second is the one that is easy to lose. `this.fd` is a
// plain writable property on the stream, so `process.stdout.fd = 7` reaches this native
// with an arbitrary number: a JS-supplied fd reaching a raw write(2) is a capability leak,
// because this binding is not a general fs.writeSync. And the conversion itself is the
// trap — a float->int conversion is undefined in Odin for NaN, ±Inf and out-of-range
// values, so `int(fd_num)` may land on ANY arm, 1 and 2 included. Comparing in f64 first
// is what makes `process.stdout.fd = NaN` reject instead of writing somewhere.
//
// LAVA-ONLY: node has no equivalent binding to diff against (its stdout owns the fd
// internally and `fd = 7` there produces an EBADF from the syscall, not a guard).
// Nothing referenced this guard before — grepping its message found only the Odin source
// — so it shipped in #326 with no test at all.
