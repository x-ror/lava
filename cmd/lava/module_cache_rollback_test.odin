// Pins module_cache_insert_new's rollback (globals.odin): when the map grow
// fails, the cloned key is freed and the JSValueProtect undone.
//
// The leak assertion is THE test. `!hit` below passes with or without the
// rollback — a failed map_insert stores nothing either way — so it pins the
// insert's failure handling, not the cleanup. The runner's own per-test
// tracking allocator does not close the gap: ODIN_TEST_FAIL_ON_BAD_MEMORY
// defaults to false (core/testing/runner.odin:40), so it logs the orphaned
// clone as a WARN and still reports the test successful. Verified by mutation:
// with the rollback deleted the runner printed `<14B/462B> (1/2)` — 14 bytes is
// exactly "rollback-probe" — and finished "All tests were successful". Hence
// the explicit before/after count through an allocator this test owns.
//
// What it does NOT pin: the JSValueUnprotect. A GC root has no allocator to
// observe it from, and the two live in the same branch, so the clone stands in
// for both. Deleting only the unprotect line would survive this test.
//
// The injection swaps the MAP, not state.allocator: a map captures its backing
// allocator at make time, so a zero-valued map with `allocator` pre-set is the
// one shape whose very first insert must grow through the failing allocator.
// The key clone still goes through state.allocator, which is what makes the
// orphan visible.
