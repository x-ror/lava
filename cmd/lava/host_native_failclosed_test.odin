// Pins the fail-CLOSED dispatcher (host_dispatch_fail, pkg/runtime/
// host_natives.odin). host_natives_release_context is exported and produces
// exactly the inconsistent-registry state while globalThis keeps the function
// object reachable, so the miss needs no production seam and no test-only hook.
// Shared helpers (make_context, eval_text, answer_cb, host_path_active) live in
// host_native_registry_test.odin.
//
// Why it is worth pinning: several natives write through a caller-supplied
// buffer and signal nothing on return, so a dispatcher answering `undefined` is
// silently WRONG rather than merely unhelpful — randomBytes would hand back
// zeroed bytes as CSPRNG output (the canonical write-up: host_dispatch_fail).
//
// Three assertions, each pinning a distinct failure this has already had:
//   1. a registered native dispatches (otherwise the rest proves nothing);
//   2. after the sweep the call THROWS, and with our message — reverting the
//      fail-closed branch gives "NO THROW: undefined", and dropping the sweep's
//      delete_key(&g_host_native_cbs, ...) gives "NO THROW: 42" because the stale
//      callee entry keeps dispatching;
//   3. the VM still works afterwards — this is what pins the private-ABI contract
//      that host_throw actually RAISED. Returning the Error object as an ordinary
//      value (which is what a bare `return exception` does when host_throw
//      no-ops) is fail-open again, not a throw.
