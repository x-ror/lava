// Guards the two allocator rules in the host-native registry
// (pkg/runtime/host_natives.odin), neither of which the repeated-eval regression
// test can see — it runs under the runner's default context, where the ambient
// and the state allocator happen to be the same heap.
//
// Rule 1 (the cached NAMES): a name is cloned inside inject_native_function,
// which is reached both from eval-time setup AND from inside native_require_cb —
// a `proc "c"` where context resets to runtime.default_context(). The clone goes
// through the captured state.allocator so the sweep frees it through the same
// one. `require('node:fs')` is the specifier that drives that path: its bindings
// are injected lazily from inside the require callback, unlike node:events
// (served by require_builtin) or node:dns (registered at eval-time setup), which
// is why module_cache_alloc_test/dns_alloc_test do not cover this.
//
// Rule 2 (the map BACKING): both tables are thread-lived and bound explicitly to
// a process-lifetime allocator. Bound implicitly they would adopt this test's
// tracking allocator, which is torn down while the tables live on — a later eval
// then writes through reclaimed memory. That shows up here as a live-allocation
// count that grows with every eval instead of settling.

// a live table. Asserting on the recorded source location pins the binding
