// net_shutdown_active iterates state.net_conns directly while net_maybe_free
// delete_keys entries under it. Every clean script closes its sockets, so the
// sweep normally runs over an empty map and the delete-during-iteration shape
// goes unexercised — the smokes only reach it on timing luck. This drives it
// deterministically: net.connect inserts the connection at INITIATION
// (net.odin, state.net_conns[conn.id] = conn), and a top-level throw returns
// from eval before the loop ever runs, so teardown sweeps a map holding three
// live in-flight connections. No listener and no port bind: the connects target
// a loopback port nothing answers, and their failure could only arrive through
// the loop, which never runs.
//
// The assertion is a DIFFERENTIAL fd census, and every simpler option was ruled
// out by mutation rather than by reasoning:
//   * a tracking allocator sees nothing. Connections are allocated and freed
//     under runtime.default_context() on purpose (net_connect_cb,
//     net_maybe_free), so they never touch the caller's allocator. Verified:
//     with the sweep mutated to skip a connection, and again with it mutated to
//     INSERT during the range (the one operation the loop's comment calls
//     unsafe), an allocator-based version of this test passed both times.
//   * an ABSOLUTE fd count is confounded: every eval leaks exactly one
//     `anon_inode:[timerfd]` whether or not it touches net — the loop's timer fd
//     is not closed by eventloop.destroy. That is a real defect, but it belongs
//     to pkg/runtime/eventloop, not to this sweep, and it is unconditional.
// So the baseline eval below is the same script minus the connects: it absorbs
// the per-eval cost, and what remains is attributable to the three sockets.
//
// SERIAL ONLY. /proc/self/fd is process-wide, so with the runner's default
// thread-per-core every other test's sockets and files land in the census: the
// first parallel run measured a baseline of -18 against +20. This test is
// therefore a member of the `make test-odin-serial` gate (CI runs it) and skips
// itself elsewhere rather than reporting noise as a leak.
