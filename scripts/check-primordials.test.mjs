// node:test view of the pollution ratchet's fixtures.
//
// The SAME table also gates the ratchet itself (lib/primordials-fixtures.mjs is
// imported by check-primordials.mjs, which refuses to report on the tree — or to
// rebaseline — when a fixture regresses). That fail-closed property is the point
// and does not move here. What this file adds is what a bespoke runner loop was
// never going to give: one named subtest per fixture, a real diff on failure, and
// `--test-name-pattern` to run a single case while iterating on a detector.
//
// Run: node --test scripts/       (or `make test-scripts`)
//
// There was no test runner for scripts in this repo, and I asserted that as a
// constraint and hand-rolled around it. node:test has been stable since Node 20
// and the repo requires 24 — the constraint was never real.
