// transport. It provides the fetch TLS surface fetch_transport.odin's https branches
// expect: fetch_tls_supported, FETCH_HTTPS_UNSUPPORTED_MSG, and the
// cleanup/handshake/write/read procs. The session bindings live in tls_darwin.odin;
// req.tls holds an opaque ^Darwin_TLS_Session (as rawptr).

//                      all records, including any previously-queued ciphertext, hit
//                      the socket.)
//   - errSSLWouldBlock: nothing is reported consumed; the caller re-arms and retries
//                      with the SAME buffer. SecureTransport may have taken part of
//                      the buffer into internal records already, so write_skip
//                      records that prefix and the retry submits only the un-taken
//                      tail — re-submitting the whole buffer would double-encode it.
//                      When the whole buffer is already taken (skip == len) the retry
//                      is a zero-length SSLWrite that just flushes the record queue.
//   - other          : a fatal/closed status, passed through unchanged.
//
// This confines SecureTransport's partial-consume-with-buffering behavior to the TLS
// layer so the shared transport keeps OpenSSL's advance-only-when-sent contract — in
// particular the chunked terminator is never reported sent until its record flushes.
