// Supervisor signal handling (Slice 3a, Linux). SIGINT/SIGTERM are blocked process-wide before the
// workers spawn (so they inherit the block) and received synchronously by the supervisor via
// rt_sigtimedwait — the sigwait approach the design chose (no async-signal handler, and core:sys/linux
// has no signalfd binding). The short timeout doubles as the poll interval for the worker-exit state.

// SUPERVISOR_TICK_MS bounds how often supervisor_wait re-checks the worker-exit state between signal
// waits — prompt crash/finish detection without a busy loop.
