// Hostname resolution for fetch (#77) runs OFF the loop (getaddrinfo blocks) on the loop's generic
// worker pool (eventloop.pool_submit) — the same pool fs/crypto/node:dns use. It previously had its
// own dedicated 4-thread process-global pool; Slice 3a folds it onto the per-loop generic pool so
// multi-core doesn't multiply thread pools (one 4-thread pool per worker, not two), and the per-loop
// pool's loop-thread-only ownership is preserved verbatim under N workers — the data race a shared
// pool would have had on its lock-free queues across N loop threads simply cannot arise.
//
// Lifetime / safety (mirrors node:dns in dns.odin):
//   - dns_resolve_work runs on a pool worker and touches ONLY its DNS_Job (an owned host copy +
//     result fields) — never the loop, the request, or the JS engine. The job carries the result
//     back; dns_resolve_done reads it on the loop thread and drives the connect.
//   - pool_submit does the async_begin that keeps the loop alive until the completion posts (and
//     undoes it itself on a start failure); the caller (fetch_transport_start) pins the REQUEST via
//     drive_pending so a cancel mid-lookup cannot free it before the completion runs.
//   - At teardown eventloop.destroy -> pool_shutdown joins the workers and runs dns_resolve_dispose
//     for any job whose completion will not fire, freeing it — so no worker posts into a freed loop.

// DNS_Job is one resolution request: an owned host copy + the ordered result (up to one IPv4 then one
// IPv6 address, #145, tried in turn by the connect path). Allocated by fetch_dns_submit, freed by
// dns_resolve_done (success) or dns_resolve_dispose (dropped at teardown) through its captured
// allocator (req.allocator at submit), so the alloc/free pair stays matched whichever path releases it.
