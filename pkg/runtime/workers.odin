// cores" means N independent shared-nothing workers — each its own { event loop + JSC context +
// Runtime_State } running the app, with the kernel load-balancing connections via SO_REUSEPORT (commit
// 5). This file is the supervisor + the startup barrier; shutdown (signalfd / stop state machine) and

// degrade: malformed / 0 / negative / oversized, or LAVA_WORKERS>1 on a non-Linux platform

//     signal race) instead of starting to serve.
//   - g_worker_crashed: a worker's loop died abnormally (backend_failed); the supervisor stops the rest.
