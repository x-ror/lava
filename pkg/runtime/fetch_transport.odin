// machine and the DNS hand-off live here and are TLS-backend-agnostic. Each platform
// supplies only the socket primitives (create/connect, send/recv, SO_ERROR check,

// Streaming request body — true chunked upload (Transfer-Encoding: chunked)
// ============================================================================
//
// Once the request head is on the wire, a streamed body is pulled from the JS
// producer one chunk at a time and framed incrementally — no full-body buffer is
// kept on either side. The flow (half-duplex: the whole request body is sent
// before the response is read):
//
//   fetch_after_write_head → fetch_body_go_idle: defers a producer pull
//     (post_async → fetch_body_drain_cb → on_body_drain). The JS pump reads its
//     source and calls push_body_fn → fetch_push_body, which frames the chunk and
//     flushes it (fetch_pump_body). When the frame fully drains, fetch_body_go_idle
//     pulls the next chunk; a blocked write arms the fd for writability and the
//     writable event (fetch_write_body_event) resumes the flush. Socket write
//     backpressure therefore pauses the producer (the next pull is not scheduled
//     until the current frame drains). end_body_fn → fetch_end_body writes the
//     terminating zero-size chunk and flips to reading the response.
//
// Recursion / liveness: the producer pull is DEFERRED via post_async (mirroring the
// response-read resume in fetch.odin) rather than invoked inline — a synchronous
// invoke would recurse one stack frame per chunk through JSC's microtask auto-drain
// (read → push → drain → pull → read …). post_async breaks that and, paired with
// async_begin + drive_pending, keeps the loop alive across the pull and pins the
// request against reclaim until the deferred completion has run.
