// Generic host-call registration for every injected native. Explicit per-proc
// wrappers (buffer_host.odin) bake their callback into a dedicated entry
// point; everything else goes through one shared trampoline that recovers the
// callback from the frame's callee slot — the JSFunction cell being invoked —
// via a pointer-keyed table. Created functions are protected (their address IS
// the dispatch key, so the cell must never be collected and reused) and cached
// per (context, callback, name), so per-instance injections like the fs.Stats
// methods reuse one function object instead of minting a new one per call —
// like methods living on a prototype.

// host_dispatch adapts JSC's internal calling convention to a C-API-shaped
// callback: argument slots ARE JSValueRefs on 64-bit, the callee/this cells
// pass as the function/thisObject parameters (nil when `this` is not a cell —
// the callbacks that read it only ever receive objects), and a callback-set
// exception becomes a real VM throw, matching JSCallbackFunction.

// that worker's thread. Per-thread maps mean registration and the per-call
// dispatch lookup never touch another worker's state — no locks on the dispatch
// path, and no data race when N workers build their bindings concurrently
// (the failure the removed process-global interning risked). The dispatch
// callback runs on the ctx-owning thread, so it reads the same thread's table.
//
// Both tables are swept per context by host_natives_release_context, called from
// destroy_runtime_state while the context is still alive. Without that sweep the
// entries outlive the context they were registered for, and JSC hands the SAME
// address to a later JSGlobalContextCreate: the {ctx, cb, name} key then collides
// with a dead context's entry, the cache returns a JSObjectRef into freed memory,
// and the new VM's object at that address is called instead (observed: the
// `allocUninit` binding resolving to Map.prototype.values, plus segfaults and
// tracking-allocator bad frees, from the 3rd-4th eval in one process).
//
// The BACKING of both maps is bound explicitly to a process-lifetime allocator,
// never implicitly to the ambient one. Odin binds a zero-valued map's allocator
// on its first grow (base/runtime/dynamic_map_internal.odin: `if
// m.allocator.procedure == nil { m.allocator = context.allocator }`), and the
// first insert happens inside setup_module_environment under the CALLER's
// context. These tables are thread-lived and never deleted, so an implicit bind
// captures an allocator that dies long before they do: under the Odin test
// runner (a per-test tracking allocator over a rollback stack that is
// free_all'd between tests) or an embedder's per-eval arena, every later insert
// writes through a reclaimed backing and corrupts whatever now occupies it.
// Same rule Runtime_State.module_cache already follows (globals.odin).

//
// The two `make` errors are DELIBERATELY dropped, and that was checked rather
// than assumed. make(map, cap, alloc) routes through make_map_cap, which sets
// context.allocator = alloc and calls reserve_map; map_reserve_dynamic then binds
// m.allocator BEFORE the allocation that can fail
// (base/runtime/dynamic_map_internal.odin: `if m.allocator.procedure == nil {

// reserve still leaves the table bound to default_allocator with data == 0 — it
// is NOT the #317 implicit-capture bug, and the very next insert simply retries
// the grow. That insert is checked (host_native_create below), so an allocation
// failure surfaces there as a declined cache and a C-API fallback, never as a
// half-built registry. The flag therefore stays set on the failing path on

// on failure alike, so the JS call sites that "discard the result" are discarding
// nothing. The two exceptions are documented at their natives: net.write's bool
// is BACKPRESSURE, not failure (Node's Socket.end ignores it too), and
// crypto.randomFill returns the view it filled, which crypto.js does check.
