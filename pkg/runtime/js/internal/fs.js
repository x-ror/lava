// node:fs — a thin JS layer over the Odin-backed primitives.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until now `node:fs` was assembled natively in require.odin and
// was the one built-in with no JS layer at all (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4 names it the
// native-direct outlier). That cost a Node-contract bug that survived a year: the read
// primitives hand back whatever `make_uint8_array` produced — a plain `Uint8Array` — where
// node returns a **Buffer**. The bytes were always right; only the prototype was wrong,
// and the failure mode is the bad one. `Uint8Array.prototype.toString` ignores its
// argument, so `fs.readFileSync(p).toString('hex')` returned `"116,121"` instead of
// `"7479"`: plausible-looking output, no throw.
//
// Tagging belongs here rather than in the native. The native would have to hold a
// protected `Buffer.prototype` per context and sweep it from destroy_runtime_state like
// every other JSC-handle cache (CLAUDE.md §4); in JS it is one `Buffer.from` over the same
// backing store. See issue #329, and #242 for the rest of the normalization this layer
// makes possible (writeFile encoding/flag/mode, SharedArrayBuffer views, a real DataView
// brand check).
//
// ZERO COPY. `Buffer.from(arrayBuffer, byteOffset, length)` shares memory by spec — it
// does NOT copy, verified on node 24.18.1 and here (mutating the Buffer is visible through
// the original view). A copy would be a per-file-size regression on the hottest fs call
// there is, and CLAUDE.md ranks memory second only to conformance.
//
// Everything else is re-exported by identity: same function objects the native branch
// installed, so nothing about the other 13 entry points changes.
