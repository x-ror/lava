// process.stdout / process.stderr.
//
// Built on the real `stream.Writable` rather than a lookalike object, because node's
// streams are Writables in every fd case and libraries feature-detect with
// `x instanceof stream.Writable` (measured on node 24.18.1: true for the tty, pipe and
// file shapes alike). A hand-rolled object with a `write` method would answer false and
// silently take the wrong branch in a logger.
//
// NODE'S SHAPE, measured rather than read off the docs — `process.stdout` is polymorphic:
//
//   stdout ->   constructor        write(300KB)   isTTY       columns
//   file        SyncWriteStream    true           undefined   undefined
//   pipe        Socket             false          undefined   undefined
//   tty         WriteStream        true           true        <number>
//
// The `undefined`s matter and are not `false`/`80`: `if (stream.isTTY)` and
// `stream.columns || 80` are the two idioms in the wild, and reporting `false`/`80` off a
// terminal makes the second one silently disagree with node. tty.js's WriteStream gets
// this wrong today (it reports isTTY false and columns 80 on a pipe); this module does
// not inherit that.
//
// SCOPE: only `isTTY` is implemented. `columns` and `rows` are absent from the prototype,
// so they read `undefined` on a terminal too — correct off one, WRONG on one, where node
// reports numbers. Supplying them needs a TIOCGWINSZ ioctl that does not exist in the
// tree yet (`linux.ioctl` and `linux.TIOCGWINSZ` are both in core:sys/linux; only the
// `winsize` struct needs declaring). Deliberately not faked to 80x24 — that is exactly
// the tty.js bug named above. Tracked in ROADMAP beside the getWindowSize entry.

   * A synchronous Writable over fd 1 or 2.
   * @param {number} fd
   * @node Mirrors process.stdout/stderr's observable surface for the non-tty case. On a
   *       terminal node also exposes `columns`/`rows`/`getWindowSize`; this stream does
   *       NOT — see the SCOPE note in the file header.
   * @deviates Two, both confined to node's PIPE shape, because this stream is one shape
   *       for every fd where node has three. Neither is visible when stdout is a file or
   *       a terminal.
   *
   *       1. No backpressure. `write()` always returns true; nothing is buffered here —
   *       the byte is on the fd before write() returns — so there is no drain to wait
   *       for. Measured against node on a pipe, the full extent (an earlier version of
   *       this block declared only the first of the five):
   *         write(300KB)/write(1MB)  node false/false   lava true/true
   *         writableLength           node 1348576       lava 0
   *         writableNeedDrain        node true          lava false
   *         'drain'                  node emitted       lava never
   *       `if (!s.write(x)) await once(s,'drain')` therefore never waits here. It also
   *       never hangs: the answer is true, so the await is skipped, not pending.
   *
   *       2. Lifecycle is forgiving where node's pipe shape is fatal. On a FILE node
   *       recovers from end()/destroy() (see the header on _destroy) and this stream
   *       matches it exactly. On a PIPE node's stdout is a net.Socket, so end() closes
   *       the write side and the next write raises an unhandled EPIPE and exits 1;
   *       verified on node 24.18.1 (`node x.js | cat` prints A, B and dies where
   *       `node x.js > f` prints A, B, C, D). This stream recovers in both cases: it
   *       holds no socket, writes go straight to the fd, and there is nothing an end()
   *       could half-close. Deliberate — the alternative is closing fd 1 and losing
   *       every later byte in the process, to reproduce a crash.
   *
   *       Pinned by tests/stdio/stdio-lifecycle.test.mjs, which drives both shapes as
   *       subprocesses; the oracle case 61 covers the file shape only, because the compat
   *       harness redirects stdout to a file (`>"$node_stdout"` in scripts/lib/compare.sh).
